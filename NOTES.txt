If we set the dimension of the simulation to one, the distribution of blocks
doesn't work. We would need to add another division, like a mpi_block, to divide
the 1D domain into mpi blocks, then each one into task blocks.

What if we use lblock_t to talk about the lowest subdivision block, expected to
run in a task. The mblock_t, to the mpi block.

In order to exchange particles from task blocks, I need to determine first:
whether the exchange can be done by shared memory, or whether I need MPI. Also I
need to design the exhange protocol to avoid any deadlock/race condition.

Let's first begin with the simple case: There is only one task per MPI process.

Then each specie block should have a list of particles to send, and another to
receive.
