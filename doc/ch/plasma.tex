\section{Everyday plasmas}

It may be surprising to find out that when we look at the universe, the most
common state of matter is plasma, which is a ionized gas formed by free
electrons and ions at a region in space--often known as the fourth state of
matter. The sun, our closest star, is a giant
ball of plasma 


Most common forms of plasma only occur in vaccum, as otherwise the air cools the
plasma and returns to a gas.

In our planet, we can see forms of plasma almost every day. A storm day the
lightnings. The spark on some piezoelectric lighters, which is the very same
principle that occurs in gasoline engines.

The Aurora Borealis, of the lightning of a fluorescent tube or the pixels of a
plasma TV.

A precise definition of a plasma is given by Chen~\cite{chen} as \textit{``a
quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which exhibits collective
behavior''}. The
