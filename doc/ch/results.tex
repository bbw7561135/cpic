The execution time is measured and analyzed in detail.

\section{Number of particles}

The number of particles $N_p$ is one of the main parameters that affect the
running time of each iteration. In order to characterize the scalability of the
application, several tests are designed with increasing number of particles, and
different metrics are compared.

The wall clock is used in the process with rank zero to measure how long takes
each iteration.
